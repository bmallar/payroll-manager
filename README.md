# payroll-manager-chall
ONLY CHANGED JAVASCRIPT

First I added my let varibles firstName, lastName, and salary then i added prompts to all of them.

Then I added const options to set an array after that i made the array with all my let varibles

After that i made a while loop ABOVE the lets to tell it keep prompting until cancel is pressed 

Next i added a if to give me an alert if they dont type anything in. and adding return pushes it back to the top

Then i console log the info provided from the varibles by making a const employeeObject and using .push to add the array varibles to the console log

Next i made a window confirm to ask if they wanted to add another employee and a return to cycle back through that

Then to pop up the average salary in the console log i used a for loop. most of the equation was already provided i just added in employeesArray.length to access the array then employeesArray[]salary to get deeper into to the array to only get the saleries

Also set sum to 0 and used parseInt in my equation because it involed numbers then i return sum diveded by the employessArray.length, which is the number of employees. thats how you find an average. 

Lastly to select a random employee from the list written in we would add the equation for a randomizer to any varible name i choose, then we console log the array with the varible connected
